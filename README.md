<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The KV app was created in an attempt to solve teething customer service issues that have been affecting customerâ€™s average order values, customer satisfaction and ultimate customer loyalty.
While there were alternatives that were created before; there is no single web application that can integrate the features that are now available.</p>
